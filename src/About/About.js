                    <p>I am Prithviraj.</p>
                    <p>Currently based in Pune, India.</p>
                    <p>I primarily shoot Fashion and Portraiture but also find myself exploring and indulging in places and experiences around the world when travelling for work or leisure.</p>

                    <p>With photography diplomas from MIT School Of Photography and Bharti Vidyapeethâ€™s School of Photography, I started my journey in photography in 2015.</p> 

                    <p>Taking inspiration from photographers like Prabuddha Dasgupta, Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Gregory Crewdson, I often find their art pushing me to work harder towards my craft. </p>

                    <p>Photography for me is about creating thought provoking pictures and trying to get the best out of people.</p>
                    <p>There is no better feeling than creating a visual that excites me and allows memories to be made in the process of it.</p>
